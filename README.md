Educational models of excellence in computer science.

Some themes to cover:

* Tools with industrial grade examples and use-cases (git, m4, emacs/vim, ptrace, etc)
  * Explore git blame and similar usage patterns - show useful, non-trivial examples
* Working effectively in various operating systems
* History of computing to motivate use cases
* Perhaps grow into a comprehensive source ranging from theory to industrial application
* Algorithms
